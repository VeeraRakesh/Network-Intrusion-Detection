## Introduction

Computer networks are constantly exposed to cyber-related attacks due to the widespread usage of the internet. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play a critical role in ensuring network security by detecting unauthorized access and attacks. This project aims to develop an efficient and effective IDS using machine learning-based approaches to monitor network traffic flow in real-time and prevent potential abuse or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The IDS will be specifically designed for Windows-based operating systems.

## Problem Statement

The increasing occurrence of network attacks poses a significant challenge for network services. Without a robust intrusion detection system, a computer network can be vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential harm, including data theft and DoS attacks.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

   - Monitor network traffic flow in real-time to detect any malicious activities.
   - Prevent abuse and overload from bandwidth and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
   - Develop a reliable and efficient intrusion detection system for Windows-based operating systems.
   - Educate household internet users about the benefits of having an intrusion detection system alongside firewall and antivirus protection.

## Literature Review

The literature review covers various types of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), including network-based, host-based, protocol-based, and application protocol-based systems. It also discusses different classes of attacks, such as DoS, U2R, R2L, and probe attacks. The review highlights the importance of using machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor for accurate intrusion detection.

## Motivation

The increasing dependency on technology and the internet has led to a massive amount of data that needs to be processed and stored securely. Security is a critical concern for users, and a secure Intrusion Detection System ensures the privacy and reliability of their data. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the proposed IDS aims to achieve advanced and reliable detection of attacks and reduce false positives.

## System Configuration

The IDS system is developed using Python 3.6.4 with related libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The dataset used for training and testing the IDS is obtained from KDD dataset available at kdd.ics.uci.edu.

## Implementation

The implementation of the IDS involves data preprocessing, dataset splitting, model training, and evaluation. Four different machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor, are used to identify different attack classes.

## Conclusion

The Intrusion Detection System using machine learning-based approaches has proven to be effective in detecting and preventing malicious activities within a network. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, the IDS achieves high accuracy rates and provides an additional layer of security alongside firewalls and antivirus protection.

# How to Use the Intrusion Detection System

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is designed to detect network intrusions and classify network activities as normal or anomalous. It utilizes the xGBoost classifier and the Decision Tree algorithm for classification. Before using the system, you need to follow the steps outlined below:

## Step 1: Download the Dataset

Download the dataset required for training and testing the Intrusion Detection System from the following link: networkintrusion.csv

## Step 2: Load the Dataset

First, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Next, run the provided code to load the dataset and summarize its content.

## Step 3: Data Pre-processing and Cleaning

The dataset may contain missing values, duplicate rows, and irrelevant features. Run the provided code for data pre-processing and cleaning:

   - Convert categorical variables to numerical representation:
        The 'protocol_type', 'service', 'flag', and 'class' columns are converted to numerical values.

   - Remove duplicate rows from the loaded dataset.

   - Handle missing values:
        Check for missing values using print(df.isnull().sum()).
        Drop rows with missing values using df.dropna(how='any', inplace=True).

   - Remove columns/features with low variance (quasi-constant features) and highly correlated columns:
        Remove features with low variance using VarianceThreshold.
        Remove highly correlated columns using the correlation matrix.

## Step 4: Split the Dataset

Split the pre-processed dataset into training and testing sets using the provided code.

## Step 5: Train the Model

Use the Decision Tree algorithm to train the Intrusion Detection System using the training dataset. The training accuracy will be displayed.

## Step 6: Test the Model

Test the trained model using the testing dataset to evaluate its performance. The testing accuracy will be displayed.

## Step 7: Optional - Try xGBoost Classifier

If you want to try an alternative classifier, you can use the xGBoost Classifier. The training and testing accuracies will be displayed.

***Ensure that you have a suitable Python environment set up with the required libraries and the dataset downloaded before executing the code. This Intrusion Detection System can help you classify network activities as normal or anomalous based on the trained model's predictions.***
